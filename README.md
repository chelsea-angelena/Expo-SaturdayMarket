# SaturdayMarket

This is a mobile app which runs in both ios and android. Saturday Market is a virtual meeting place for people to get together 'weekend-market-style' to sell handcrafted goods, works of art, or second hand treasures. Scan the QR code on your mobile phone, or run it in the browser with the simulator. Make a post, update your profile, and save favorite posts. User authentication and database has been created with Firebase/Firestore and the app has been built entirely using react functional components and hooks, on the React-Native/Expo framework.
