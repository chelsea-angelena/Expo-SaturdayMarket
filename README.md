# SaturdayMarket

Social mobile app for people to sell their handmade goods or lightly used items. Scan the QR code on your mobile phone, or run it in the browser with the simulator. Make a post, update your profile, and save favorite posts. User authentication and database has been created with Firebase/Firestore and the app has been built entirely using react functional components and hooks, on the React-Native/Expo framework.
